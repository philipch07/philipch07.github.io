# About Me
As you (probably) already know, my name is Reifon Philip Chiu. I was born in Philadelphia, PA, in 2002. I enjoy playing mostly multiplayer [games](/games), puzzle solving, writing code, and listening to [music](/music). I have an older brother and a younger sister.

# Hobbies
There are a good number of things that I am interested in. I've already listed a few above, but here are a few more.
- ok all of a sudden i am unable to come up with anything else.

# Old Hobbies
There are a good number of things that I was interested in. I enjoyed them while they lasted. This isn't to say that I'll never do them again, but it's rather improbable that they'll ever stage a comeback.
- video editing - used to make a ton of videos. If you look hard enough you can still see they're still up on youtube.
- playing violin and piano - used to play violin and piano (classical), but I progressed far too slowly and had a hard time pushing myself to practice and didn't have much drive to improve.
- mining ethereum - did this with an rx560 and ended up with nothing. The miner kept crashing lol.
- playing with stocks - did this as part of a long term project for a class in my senior year of H.S. I did ridiculously well before sars-cov-2.
- tracking sars-cov-2 - did this as soon as I heard of it. Stopped as soon as school let out in March 2020.
- thinking way too hard about things - I can't say that I don't do this at all anymore, but I definitely used to do this an uncomfortable amount. I'd like to think that I've calmed down a bit.

# Hobbies On Hold
There are a good number of things that I am interested in but can't do, for whatever reason.
- traveling - I never used to enjoy traveling, and was quite a nuisance when traveling with my family. I have recently (jan2021) started to think better of traveling, although at the moment I prefer traveling with close friends.
    - I have a couple places in mind that I'd like to go to:
        - Stockholm, for TI10
        - Somewhere in France that isn't urban
        - Somewhere in Cali
- pen spinning - I used to do this a small amount in HS, but never had a very good spinning pen. I haven't put a ton of time into learning new tricks in HS.

## Undergrad
I currently attend SEAS@UPenn (2024), and am planning to major in CS.
I do not currently enjoy my time at penn (as of jan2021).

## HS and before
I graduated from J.R. Masterman H.S. and M.S. I didn't enjoy my time there, but I had a good deal of formative experiences during my HS years. My favorite class that I took at Masterman was Discrete I and Discrete II from CCP during my senior year.
I came from Anne Frank E.S. I think I enjoyed my time there. Things were simpler then. My fondest memory of that school was being called by the principal (Commons) to help explain algebra (I was introduced to it from FirstInMath, and grinded that thing to hell and back), even though I had no clue what I was talking about.
My mom told me that I almost got kicked out preschool and would constantly get in trouble during daycare for biting other kids. I was such a nuisance when I was a kid. I applaud my parents for dealing with me. I'm not even going to talk about my brother when he was young :)
