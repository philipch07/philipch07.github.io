      <h1 id="favourites">Favourites</h1>

</ul>

<div id="spoiler" style="display:none">
Zeal by kkscope. The music absolutely blew me away, and oh _man_. It is absolutely amazing. I don't even want to begin to describe it because I wouldn't be doing the album a favour. Take a listen. I hope you enjoy it. (And if you don't, I'm sorry :&lt;  )

</ul>

<p>Clearly, I like a lot of artists. I also definitely don’t have a lot of CCM since it is my most disliked genre of Christian Music. Also, I don’t always like all the music from these artists. I also stay away from their social medias simply because it’s a whole other thing to do and social media is a black hole.</p>

<p>Anyways, I tried to pick the artists that had a large impact on me or that have been consistently amazing with their music. Note that the or is inclusive lol.</p>

<p>If I had to pick my favourite of them, I don’t think it’d be possible. There are simply too many amazing artists for me to just pick one. Instead, I’ll highlight a few of them and talk about what it is that I enjoy from them (and maybe a bit about what I don’t like about them).</p>

<ul>
  <li>y&amp;f - lyrics are sometimes hit or miss. For the most part, they have a good number of bangers and are almost always upbeat. Their slower songs are also fantastic, even if it is a change of pace. Pretty solid for the most part, but they have some pretty high highs.</li>
  <li>s&amp;s - absolutely amazing hymns, and they do an amazing job covering so many songs in their Worship Initiative volumes. Their hymn covers are so amazing. I wish they could produce a bit more original music, but what they have is still amazing and it probably isn’t worth compromising what their quality for quantity.</li>
  <li>mosaic - lotsa bangers, lotsa fun. Their music is mostly upbeat like y&amp;f but they pull off a lot of the modern aspects of music wonderfully. Their lyrics are typically very solid as well.</li>
  <li>citi - I LOVED their music. I still dislike CCM, but citi’s music is so strong that I wouldn’t mind listening to their <em>albums</em> on repeat. Absolutely brilliant.</li>
  <li>kkscope - mindblowing. I love their music <em>so much</em>. Having two drums, having a bit of a brass section, having full on orchestras, there is so much to love about them. Super expressive and super genuine.</li>
  <li>r&amp;r - super chill lo-fi and amazing music. Loved the instrumental project (“Still”, there are 3 vols across different artists). It makes me want to listen to so much more Christian lo-fi that isn’t like 90% instrumentals. Amazing group.</li>
  <li>jogden - if you didn’t know, jogden is the main singer in r&amp;r, but his own projects are still fantastic. Great for silent reflections or even for taking a break.</li>
  <li>seu - amazing music. They pull off pop amazingly, and their lyrics are pretty solid.</li>
  <li>eulogy - fan<em>tastic</em> lyrics. I love their ability to just run so quickly and so far with what they choose. If you love rap and thinking hard, or even if you want to be called out , eulogy is great.</li>
  <li>psail - amazing covers of old (old to me, that is :&gt; ) songs.</li>
  <li>mineo - fantastic lyrics and great story. So much to reflect on and to see his personal journey so upclose is amazing.</li>
  <li>nak - even though not all of his songs are explicitly Christian, they are amazingly thought provoking. He also brings up topics that most asian minorities do not bring up, simply due to the culture of asian people generally being much less active/progressive/submissive.</li>
  <li>sajan - lyrics are sometimes hit or miss, but the beats are great, and the music is generally solid. For the songs where the lyrics hit, it just feels amazing.</li>
  <li>MHM - amazing albums, amazing work. Imo kkscope deserves to be on this list twice.</li>
  <li>isla - absolutely fantastic music. Their more recent works are mindblowingly fantastic, especially their Soul Hymns album. Great music, great passion, great lyrics all around.</li>
  <li>rsqd/wyld/whitaker/montell/isly - I just need more of this stuff. Beautiful work, super chill vibes, and great conveying of their emotions and feelings.</li>
  <li>gable - a great mixup and solid music. The lyrics and stories are also extremely enjoyable, and I love their originality.</li>
  <li>impact - the only non-english group I have on here, but they definitely have some gems. If you speak french, <em>please</em> let them be more well known. I love this group even though it’s a bit small and it looks like they might be dying out.</li>
</ul>

<p>To my friend: Nathan Lin. He goes to Rutgers and is in the same year as me. He has a small <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkhfEVMBl2k4R0ey96ol3tQ">youtube channel</a>. Please support this man. He’s insanely talented (he plays piano, guitar, bass, drums, cajon, and MORE), and his music is also amazing.</p>
