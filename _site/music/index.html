      <p>As you probably know, I primarily listen to Christian music.
As you probably don’t know, “Christian music” has a ton of different interpretations and meanings, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Music that is “Christian”</li>
  <li>Music that is <em>for</em> “Christians”</li>
</ul>

<p>And then there’s the question: what is Music that is “Christian”, to which some answers are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Music that is played on Sundays at church</li>
  <li>Music that is by a “Christian” artist</li>
  <li>Music that is by an artist who is no longer “Christian”</li>
  <li>Music that has “Jesus” in the lyrics
and many, many more.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there are a ton of different answers to this question and it makes the whole thing a lot less clear.</p>

<p>I also struggle a bit with defining what “Christian music” is, but I definitely listen to a <em>ton</em>.</p>

<p>For a bit of context, I grew up playing piano and violin clasically. I wasn’t very good and dropped it. At that point, my world of music consisted mainly of classical music, and just about every other genre was terrible to me.</p>

<p>Some time in 2018, I was introduced to more “contemporary” Christian music. Before that I’d only listened to hymns, which I didn’t enjoy as much due to the older english and repetitive structure.</p>

<p>The first band I’d listened to was Elevation Worship. I really enjoyed their music and would listen to them non-stop in the summer of 2018. After that, I realized that there was a lot more potentially decent music than I thought there was.</p>

<p>I’d begun to listen to a ton of “Christian music” on spotify after that – I’d listen to songs that I’d heard once or twice before and really sit down to enjoy and understand them. Then, I’d begun my main mission: to listen to every song that an artist had up on spotify at the time. For the most part, I’d skip Christmas songs. I’d also skip some songs that clearly aren’t Christian.</p>

<p>This still opens the question: what exactly is “Christian music” and how do I answer this question?</p>

<p>I don’t feel like I have a clear answer. Some music may help me “feel close to God”, or may make me reflect on my life in a specific way, which I believe can count as a “Christian song/music”, even though it might have a different impact for a different person. I don’t believe that there is necessarily an objective answer for those edge cases.</p>

<p>More on my answer later.</p>

<h1 id="genres">Genres</h1>
<p>Like I stated before, I grew up with a classical background. I didn’t initially enjoy hymns because I couldn’t fully understand what was going on (in terms of the big picture of the music and lyrics). I was hesitant to sit down and enjoy other genres.</p>

<p>Oh, and as a note: please, <em>PLEASE</em> take my stuff with a grain of salt. I am just another person. I will try my best to respect other’s opinions. Please try your best to respect mine too, even if you disagree.</p>

<p>The first genre I enjoyed was Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). It was pretty decent save for the fact that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>it can be insanely repetitive</li>
  <li>it can be insanely repetitive</li>
  <li>it can be insanely repetitive</li>
  <li>it can be insanely repetitive</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s how you make a bridge for a CCM song.</p>

<p>More seriously, I also disliked how “manufactured” some songs were – some songs were clearly made to be (almost a) parody of some popular pop song that was recently released, so listeners would be more inclined to listen to the “Christian version”, or a song similar to what their more secular friends would listen to. I absolutely detest it. I think my only tolerance for that stuff is if:</p>
<ol>
  <li>it is pretty decent (which is extremely subjective, of course)</li>
  <li>it is a joke</li>
  <li>it is hilarious because of how absolutely <em>terrible</em> it is</li>
</ol>

<p>A quick example is the following: <a href="https://youtu.be/hTWKbfoikeg">Smells like teen spirit - Nirvana</a> vs. <a href="https://youtu.be/1tlr6loxM_g">Perfect Day - Planetshakers</a>.</p>

<p>I know I have a weird sense of humor and I typically laugh at strange things. The first time I listened to that I laughed so hard. That was a clear example of utter <em>garbage</em>. Anyways, lets move on.</p>

<p>CCM was the first genre I really listened to. It’s also my most disliked genre, however, it isn’t absolutely terrible. There are a few songs that are fine even though they are CCM, and so I’ve come to enjoy some of them. Some songs, however, clearly were not exactly for me. Some have decent music. Some have decent lyrics. My suggestion is to take in small doses and only listen to the good stuff. There is a <em>LOT</em> of bad CCM songs out there. I have spent many hours in a headache when trying to go through all the songs of a CCM artist. Don’t make the same mistake.</p>

<p>The next genre I listened to a bit of was a bit of folk/country. I haven’t really heard any terrible stuff with this genre, so it’s pretty safe. I also haven’t listened to a ton of folk/country, but again, it’s fine from my experience. My recommendation: enjoy it.</p>

<p>Soft/Alternative Rock was pretty good. Most of it is alright, but CCM sometimes blends over this genre as well, which can sometimes take away from the songs. Indie artists are usually pretty good if you enjoy their music. My recommendation: enjoy it.</p>

<p>Pop/trap has been pretty good, even though some lyrics can be rather… shallow. Sometimes the music is also overdone, which takes away from the music. As a general rule for all genres, a good artist knows when to add more and when to <em>not</em> add more, and the best know when to <em>remove</em>. Pop is pretty consistently enjoyable. My recommendation: find your specific artist and listen to them a ton.</p>

<p>Indie is <em>amazing</em>. There are a <em>ton</em> of different flavours and sounds and <em>wow</em>. If you haven’t found your favourite indie artist, I’m sad that you havent, but I’m almost entirely sure that you’ll find one that you’ll just <em>love</em>. This is definitely among one of my favourite genres, because of the genuine heart that the artists have and because of the raw emotion and feelings that they often include. My recommendation: search far and wide and discover an amazing world of music. There is so much undiscovered beauty here.</p>

<p>Orchestral is pretty good. I haven’t listened to this a lot because my music theory is very crude and it basically misses a good chunk of the picture, however, even without a lot of music theory, orchestral music is still amazing and is a beautiful piece of art. My recommendation: try it out and see if you like it, but some songs are far older and longer than some more simpler newer ones.</p>

<p>Electric (including all the hip/jazz/glitch hop stuff) is pretty nice, except some things are just done way too much. I have come to enjoy this genre a lot, but I don’t listen to it too much. My recommendation: listen to it if you need a lot of stuff in your ears/need to get hyped up.</p>

<p>Lo-fi is definitely among my favourite as well even though it blends into indie a bit. As usual, lofi is super chill. Very enjoyable, and hard to find a bad song. My recommendation: it’s almost always good.</p>

<p>Rap is surprisingly great. I don’t listen to the super heavy rap/trap/hiphop artists, but this genre has definitely been one of my favourite because of how much more expressive rappers have been with their thoughts about theology and in confronting issues (including more modern/political ones) in a very clear and clever way. Also some of the bars in these songs just make you have to pause whatever you’re doing to think about your life. My recommendation: can listen to it a TON. Very enjoyable to sit down and understand the lyrics.</p>

<h1 id="my-answer-which-isnt-really-an-answer">My answer (which isn’t really an answer)</h1>

<p>The best answer I have, however, is my massive playlist of “Christian” music that I enjoy and am often working on. This playlist is my greatest creation yet with over 2000 songs and over 160 hours of listening time. That’s just 8 hours shy of music for an entire week, 24/7. I understand that the music isn’t for everyone, which is why there are a variety of songs in there. I think there is at least one song in my playlist that anyone will enjoy, simply because there are so many different flavours. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5tpMsJ5h8BuhxNYsyS4pK1?si=Uh57gnlESZqIG9lEL2ikQg">Enjoy here.</a> You might find something you like, even if you aren’t Christian or religious.</p>

<p>In making this playlist I initially wanted to just add every Christian song that I liked, and the concept behind it changed a lot over the years. I’m constantly adding more songs and usually only take away any accidental duplicates. The music in the playlist generally follows the order of the genres that I described above, however, there are a ton of other genres in between that could make it a bit more difficult to easily get.</p>

<p>If you also listen to a ton of Christian music you will notice that I have listened to many, many other playlists as well. In fact, one of the playlists that helped me transition from just CCM to other genres was Josh Keefe’s “Spirit” playlist, which he posted in the description of a video where he was critiquing CCM. I think there are many, many things to learn from each of the songs in my playlist and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</p>

<p>Another thing I’ve recently come to think about is how there can sometimes be a difference between the artist’s intent and the listener’s interpretation when it comes down to something artistic (which definitely includes music). One concept that I’ve been thinking about recently is how a “non-Christian song” can be Christian for someone despite not being Christian for other people. I think it is also possible that a song that is “Christian” according to the artist can be considered “non-Christian” by some listeners. It depends on the person, and it introduces a bit of subjectiveness into something that’s already not entirely well defined.</p>
