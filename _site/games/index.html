<main>
      <p>Like most people, I’ve grown up playing games.
Unlike most people, I seem to get motion sick when playing computer games, but this seems to go away when I spend even more time playing them. The only problem is that each time I get motion sick, I have trouble doing anything for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>I mostly only play multiplayer games nowadays, primarily because I get ~scared~ playing single player games. Unfortunately that means that I can only play single player games when I have a friend who is with me. Fortunately that means that I can play single player games with a friend. I don’t know why I get scared of playing single player games alone.</p>

<p>Most of the games I play are on steam.</p>

<p>Here’s a list of some of the games that I’ve played a while for on steam (name of game, hrs):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dota 2, 3.2k+</li>
  <li>CSGO, 1.4k+</li>
  <li>Terraria, 500+</li>
  <li>TF2, 200+</li>
  <li>Brawlhalla, 200+</li>
  <li>Risk of Rain 2, 170+</li>
  <li>Risk of Rain, 80+</li>
  <li>Skyrim, 60+</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also a few games that I’ve played which weren’t on steam, however, I can’t remember all of them. I do remember that I played a LOT of Destiny 2 back when it was on Battle.net, but I don’t know how many hours I put into the game. It was definitely over a couple hundred, though.</p>

<p>There are a few games that I know I’ll continue to play for a while:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SSBM</li>
  <li>Genshin Impact</li>
</ul>

<p>I play Melee as a way to keep my mind and hands moving. I play Genshin as a way to keep my mind off and to have some non-committal grind should I have any extra time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ui0ExdoEBNA">#FREEMELEE</a>.</p>

<p>I am also looking to get controller plugs for my gcc since I have noticed my knuckles/hands feeling a bit annoyed after playing for a few hours. I will probably get a pair of short and tall plugs from Battle Beaver Customs, and will experiment with where they go (I typically use R to pshield, and I use L/R in the same direction that I wavedash. I L-cancel with L though.)</p>

<p>My main game that I play is Dota 2. I will definitely be playing less during a semester as opposed to summer/winter breaks. My peak rank is Divine 2, and I have been extremely close to 5k but only attempted to get there once. I probably will be dropping Dota since it is quite a taxing game for me to play, especially since I have to play it a lot in order to play well.</p>

<h2 id="to-be-played">To Be Played</h2>
