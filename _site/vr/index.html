      <p>From the first BreakTheCode puzzle contest by .tech Domains, I was extremely fortunate to be drawn as a runner-up winner of the Voynich room, which meant that I won an Oculus Quest 2 (256 gb).</p>

<h1 id="my-limited-experience">My (Limited) Experience</h1>
<p>As of January 2021, I’ve only had my oc2 (oculus quest 2 vr headset) for about a month, and have only been able to play games since my winter break had started. Setting up the oc2 by itself was not much of a problem, and launching things for the first time was both extremely captivating and terribly off-putting due to my sensitivity to motion in games. After the initial setup, I found it a bit difficult to figure out what other things I had to do before being able to play games. Eventually I could get some things worked out, I figured out how guardian, oculus link, and virtual desktop (the app) works. Unfortunately, I found out (and spent HOURS trying to troubleshoot) that my usb 3.0 ports would only work as usb 2.0. And my usb-c port wouldn’t work at fast speeds, even with the cable that came with the oc2. I also don’t have a long, high-quality usb-c cable. See my specs <a href="/specs">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things I dislike about my VR experience is how <em>blurry</em> things are. I understand that most people do not share this issue, but I haven’t been able to getting my things to look decent despite having spent hours trying to figure out the issues. I wish I could play HLA (Half Life: Alyx) with a 3 meter usb cable (and with my usb 3.0 port working properly), or better yet, wirelessly. I also wish I could turn up the graphics quality, but my specs are barely able to run VR. Unfortunately it just looks… not very good. When looking at my perspective from my laptop, it looks pretty good, perhaps somewhere between 720 and 1080p.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that using SideQuest’s commands to bump it up will help a good amount. Also, the resolution of the oc2 compared to the valve index (the best purchaseable vr headset that I know of) clearly shows that it isn’t all the way up there. And my specs are definitely on the low-end.</p>

<h1 id="vr-games">VR Games</h1>
<p>I haven’t played many VR games, but I have played more than one.</p>

<p>Games I’ve played:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Half Life: Alyx</li>
  <li>Beat Saber</li>
  <li>Elven Assassin</li>
</ul>

<p>Games I’ve not yet played but own:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SUPERHOT: VR</li>
  <li>Wrath of Asguard</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hla">HLA</h2>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/games">games page</a>, I typically play singleplayer games with a friend. So, when it came to HLA (NO SPOILERS), I haven’t gotten very far (@ chapter 5 as of jan2021), and only play when I’m with a friend. Also, I only play HLA with a 2 meter usb cable, which is necessary since playing wirelessly is completely unplayable (terrible in-game stutters, my internet speed isn’t super fast) and gives me terrible motion sickness, and I don’t have a longer usb cable.</p>

<p>I enjoy HLA and look forward to playing it more, even though I struggle a bit with the aiming (not a surprise since I haven’t been playing for too long), and I struggle with some spooky parts (again, I have a very low tolerance for spooky things in ALL games).</p>

<h2 id="beat-saber">Beat Saber</h2>
<p>I enjoy Beat Saber, and have put in a good few hours. I completed every stage in the campaign in 2 days, save for stage 17. I attempted to mod Beat Saber according to <a href="https://bsaber.com">bsaber</a> but I had a hard time getting stuff working, so I have very few songs. Still, a very, very fun game. And I can play this one alone! :)</p>

<p>A great way to burn calories. I just wish I could figure out how to sync songs from my computer since it feels weird doing it inside the oc2.</p>

<h2 id="elven-assassin">Elven Assassin</h2>
<p>I played Elven Assassin with a friend and enjoyed the game, however, I didn’t realize how wimpy my arms were, so playing for about half an hour was totally exhausting for my left arm (bow), but my right arm was fine (arrow).</p>

<h2 id="wrath-of-asguard">Wrath of Asguard</h2>
<p>I saw some posts online about Wrath of Asguard being a very good game to play after HLA (which I haven’t finished as of jan2021), but I only played it for 5-10 mins because I got motion sick very quickly and I got annoyed at how quickly I softlocked myself by walking into a rock. Also, because of my specs (and internet speed), the game looked terrible. If I do ever come back, I’ll try played wired, I guess.</p>

<h2 id="superhot-vr">SUPERHOT: VR</h2>
<p>I bought this for my brother lol</p>
