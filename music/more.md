# A Clearer Explanation

There are a lot of things that I didn't specifically talk about in my main music page that I should expound upon because I do have a few extra things to note.

First off, my main playlist is called "Beroea", which is an alternative name of Berea (the more commonly used name). Berea is the name of a city in the Roman Empire that was mentioned in the Bible. More specifically, Paul told the Bereans (the people in Berea) to examine the scriptures to see if things were really true when put side by side with what others were saying/claiming to be true. As the name suggests, I spent a great deal of time trying to look at the lyrics more in depth, to figure out where certain lyrics came from, what they mean to me and what they originally meant, what the artist's intent was, etc. I was also encouraged by ["The Berean Test"](https://thebereantest.com), which is a website that I'd found a few months into my playlist (which was previously called "likey", since I'd liked the songs in the playlist LOL).

As I may have already mentioned, you can see that most of the music in my playlist is in a bit of an order by artist since I try my best to listen to all the songs that an artist releases on spotify. If you would like to suggest some more, please [reach out to me](/contact), but **DON'T USE MY BUSINESS EMAIL**.

# Artists

Here are the artists that I've already gone through (keep in mind that there may be some newer songs by them that I haven't gotten around to, in which case, refer to the previous sentence). Also, note that I may have abbreviated their name. Any notes will be in brackets next to their name. If you see "[r: abc/xyz]", that means I will probably refer to the artist as "abc" or "xyz". Most should be pretty self explanitory but whatever.
