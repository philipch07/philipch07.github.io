# Mashups
If you haven't heard a mashup before, you're missing out. In essence, a mashup is the combination of two different songs. If it's ever in a performance, it's super hype to be there during the transition and to be able to see two songs get combined by the genius of the artist(s) and musician(s). If you search through [my big playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5tpMsJ5h8BuhxNYsyS4pK1?si=IS0l7EIJQIi4HyRC9vnQkg), you can easily see what I'm talking about. (Most songs actually use "/" or "//" or "+" to denote a mashup. Unfortunately Spotify doesn't allow for searching either of those...)

Ok, as a work-around, here are a few songs:
- [Pursue / All I Need Is You - Hillsong Worship/y&f](https://open.spotify.com/track/58TKUOfACHyUpWE5DisSVF?si=_gwjG1NOQPCwtb6aZj2r9w)
- [Tremble // What A Beautiful Name - Phil Wickham](https://open.spotify.com/track/4tbpeUyxVuC2PhOOEf6XZM?si=9mhdwa99QHGBwE_aIaEtoQ)
- [One Thing Remains / This Is Amazing Grace - Phil Wickham/Jeremy Riddle](https://open.spotify.com/track/6T7Y2HwYDxV4OTasDV2weM?si=6T68zA1XTNu1HAqFd-NNCw)

Those are pretty decent mashups. There are obviously better ones as well, and there are also a lot of them that just _don't exist on spotify_. It obviously takes a lot of work and creativity to come up with decent transitions for mashups, or else they sound a bit lazy or lackluster. In my opinion, I will define a good mashup to be the combination of two songs with a transition that actually involves a bit of effort. The effort might not always be easily seen by the audience, but might require a decent chunk of work by the artists. Obviously this is fairly vague, however, I think most people can agree that some of the mashups by Urbana Worship are pretty lazy. They seem to just take two songs and slam them together at one point and call it a mashup. On the other hand, some mashups are pretty decent, such as [Worthy of It All + All of the Glory - upperroom](https://open.spotify.com/track/34ew6RN27bT5sIHL3IqFGA?si=ENV_FlxBQR24qsMs_bun3g), which actually goes _back and forth_ between the two songs. It's amazing, even though it is fairly repetitive. It depends where you put this a set, I guess.

As you can tell, there's a good amount of work that goes into each song, and even moreso for mashups.

As you can also probably tell, I've listened to enough Christian music to recognize when two songs sound fairly similar. Unfortunately my memory isn't as good as it once was, since (tangent warning) I received very little sleep for months on end during 11th grade, and suffered immensely during that time. Regardless, the damage has been done, and I must live with what I have been given (and am very grateful for that which I have had and currently have). Here's the list of similar sounding songs that I've found. It definitely isn't complete, and is far more rough compared to the other things that I've made. If you want to use them, go ahead. Just let me know how it goes, and what you came up with! Feel free to email my business email for this stuff if you don't have any of my other contacts.

Without further adieu, here's what I've gathered.
- faithful erik nieder and fall afresh bethel music -- intro
- Burn like a star rend collective and breathe jonny diaz -- intro/main theme
- control for king and country and oceans (where feet may fail) pre chorus (?) or main theme (?) not sure
- Rise colton dixon bridge and you are colton dixon bridge
- The moment of truth matthew west chord progression and yes and amen
- smells like teen spirit and perfect day (by planetshakers)
- See a victory bridge (elevation worship) and sovereign over us bridge (shane and shane)
- tethered bridge (phil wickham) and oceans (hillsong) bridge (?)
- God with us (Jesus culture) and there is another in the fire (hillsong united)
- king of glory (you restore my soul) (all sons and daughters) and king of love (I AM THEY)
- the victory is yours by bethel music and thank you God for saving me by chris tomlin
- wonder (live) by bethel bridge and presence power glory verse
- you came to my rescue by passion and unstoppable God by elevation worship
- As i am by sanctus real and anthem by phil wickham
- it is finished by passion and resurrection power by chris tomlin
- little by little by citipointe live and king of kings by hillsong worship
- the cause of Christ by kari jobe and rise and stand by citipointe live
- Rhythms of grace - hillsong chapel and scandal of grace
- center of your love - kim walker smith and worthy of it all + all of the glory by UPPERROOM
- 11 miles and some sanctus real song i think
- rock of our salvation - bright city and behold the lamb - highlands worship
- hope has a name (runway sessions) - river valley worship and cornerstone - hillsong worship
- in every way - christy nockels and king of kings - hillsong worship
- the waiting - matt maher and something i can't remember
- shout to the lord hillsong and altogether good citizens intro
- jesus you alone - highlands worship and only a holy god - citipointe live
- throne of grace - highlands worship and spirit break out - william mcdowell
- revelation song and emmanuel - highlands worship
- one - sleeping at last and so will i (100 billion x) (orchestral version and normal version) - hillsong united
- bridge of underdressed - gable price and friends and how he loves - john mark mcmillan

Sidenote, highlands worship has a lot of songs that sound a bit similar to some more well known CCM songs.

Oh right, I forgot to mention (sorry) that mashups are typically made of two _CCM_ songs. Yeah. It's kinda lame. But it's fun, both to think about and to pull off.

# The end?
Alright. This is super far. I'm like 3 more's in. Is this the end? Of course not! I still have more to talk about! :) More specifically, I'll go over some of my other playlists (including my friends' playlists), and some other projects that I have in the works, which would otherwise never see the light of day.
