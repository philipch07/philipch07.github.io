# Playlists and friends and projects

## Playlists
As you know, my main playlist is [Beroea](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5tpMsJ5h8BuhxNYsyS4pK1?si=OyxTO86MQnuIfhLWnimUEg), which contains music that should all be Christian to me (or to me previously).

As you don't know, I have a playlist that contains the songs that have impacted _me_. _Personally_. I haven't gone through it all in a while, but you can very clearly see what I enjoyed and what I struggled with. I usually don't freely give out this playlist because of how some of the songs are so personal to me. But as a thanks for reading so far (or for skipping ahead, idc), [here it is](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3QAq8ezVfEAJFkYc22FE3s?si=MjWxWEtfSkCUiL_udCXGfw). It's called "heart", simply because it contains the songs that were close to my heart (either before or at present, as long as it once was near my heart I put it in).

I have a few other playlists as well that I will not be making public. If you know me irl you can maybe ask me for them so long as I know you well, and if you also appreciate music. Other than that I don't really feel like explaining them.

## Friends
I've been lucky to find many friends who have fantastic playlists. I won't be putting their name on my website since I haven't asked for their permission to do so. But if their playlist is public on their profile, I will list it below.
- [Lit](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0uSgkg9MRADCC1zOjdwVII?si=0uPM3mo9TnW6ql3IDF78OQ)
- [Litüõê](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3HxT32Gmd6G5OflV4kxtPC?si=IxU0pDFcRYK7uEv4zlWaNw)
- [jesus jams](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5G5wl1iKTB51O6XqoC3voa?si=zX1cR3__Q9iwtL1UcX4l2Q)

- [Worship](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/321hI2hQa9NYR9iT38LRmV?si=KND28zNoR0SROyO-NbX11A)

I haven't gone through all of them since I've been fairly busy going through my huge artist list. From time to time I like to check how my friends are doing by looking at what music they're listening to (if I even do check, it's just to see if they've added any new songs to their playlists). Unfortunately they don't seem to be listening to music very much recently. Such is life.

## Projects
Now this is where stuff gets a bit fun. If you know me, I typically get eager when it comes to projects. I get excited, I get zealous, I get hype. I also typically begin to overthink things because I love to think about doing things. Doing them, on the other hand, perhaps not as much.

These projects aren't like the coding ones that I've made, but are more about playlists centered around specific things. Like what, you might ask? Here, check out my friends two playlists:
- [peace in adversity](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4EnJ3EkVZhn4ETdbYwXvyi?si=DOI7Z0p2THWWUXgEEDVwpA)
- [goodness](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3wXhWMT7va9WAASegL57EP?si=vf74sVkITKyeytJ4m85pbw)

It's pretty clear that both of them are centered around specific themes. Those are not terribly easy to make, and figuring out the right pacing and flow that I want to give it is a whole other adventure. Figuring out what songs provoke what feelings, managing how the listener feels to ensure that they aren't too bogged down, ensuring that a tender moment isn't ruined, continuing the hype or the build that a song gives, there are so many things that I just love thinking about.

Unfortunately, working through these projects takes a _lot_ of time, since it involves listening to music over and over and over, trying to remember what had what, and trying to determine what fits and what doesn't as your concept of the playlist evolves as songs are actually being put in. It's a bit fun to try and solve the conflict between what you initially wanted the playlist to be, and what the playlist is leaning to become.

I've made just a few projects, however, they obviously aren't finished. I also haven't really given them to _anyone_. So here's my debut of my unfinished projects, and a bit of insight into what they're about.
- [new](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ZwTJawwVK8ONnlwdI8wu4?si=who--ricSWiW5nava5RxiA) - Comprised of songs that would make anyone sit and think. These songs have hit me incredibly hard. definitely a WIP (work in progress).
- [paix dans l'adversite](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7kk0R6PGnDa7xri6OlrmCI?si=EFTtLfPtSzqkcHijiQOiDA) - A spin-off of my friend's peace in adversity. I wanted an even calmer version that would be better for reflecting since he included some more hype songs in his. Also since I have listened to more indie Christian artists, it might come in handy since I may know some good songs. a WIP for sure.
- [Where do they go?](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4F1UtFj1kIr7UZ8hYKvYYp?si=NqgrSF4LQa6ngIgUf7jGcA) - A playlist I made for a friend when he lost a loved one. The name of the playlist obviously makes us wonder where our loved ones go. The playlist doesn't answer it though. It is more about reflecting upon where we are headed as those who have gone before us finish their race.
- [!prim√©](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Fjy3hZMiu2nhZoj823wSq?si=rVgZOU7KROKNE0IC7usITw) - A playlist I made for myself for when I get depressed again. In french, depressed translates as deprim√©, but I decided to replace the "de" with "!" to obscure the name a bit and to make my listeners think a bit more. It doesn't really answer my struggles. It just tries to listen to me and comfort me. Like a friend. But it also lets me be tender. The song Mama by The Collection implies that there may be a few paths out of my situation, and it might not fit the ideals of others. I've also tried to balance the playlist such that it doesn't dive straight into the raw emotion and sadness that one might experience in the depths of depression. It moves its way down, slowly, but it tears at the soul. And it hurts. <!-- think about just how much we sing "tear our walls down" and "pierce our hearts". this is no different. I love this playlist because it helps me to examine my own heart and it helps me face my mortality and to remember how little I am worth, and yet, how much I truly am because of that. -->
- [feelsbadman](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/40T6C7mbPf3EbbwPMGr9eL?si=rzg8oeiOROGuReGSjDRZZg) - A playlist that would have sad vibes. Clearly unfinished, and for sadboy hrs only.
- [feelsgoodman](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1yS67JCl8OLYPGWnsU07li?si=huaHooguSXujUY-q60vBuA) - A playlist that would have happy vibes. Clearly unfinished, and for happy things only. I love [Haha Hallelujah](https://open.spotify.com/track/6YiLUwKFlCpTPC9k1dtSim?si=amIcIKRCSy6zt9Up3Rqxhg). I actually laugh so much when I listen to the song. It's beautiful. Almost always a great song to lift the mood. <!-- also a great song to help me cry and reflect. -->

# Another Thanks
Well, now you've had a deep look into my soul and I feel like there isn't much else to know about me. Just kidding :P ! There's a good amount more to know about me that I can't simply put in a website.

Again, I am no perfect person. I am just another hypocrite like everyone else is. I don't always have the will to do this, but when I do, I try to be a good person. Even if you aren't religious, I hope that's the one thing that you take away from this.

Clearly, I love Christian music, even though a lot of it is terrible. Thanks for staying with me through all of this. I'll probably add more in the future, but who knows where things will go. Thanks so much again, and much love.

<!-- please, try your best to be a good person. slow down your life for a moment an just enjoy it. -->
