Vraiment, merci beaucoup. Ma vie n'est pas parfait. Ca ne sera jamais parfait. C'est vraiment la nature de la vie. <br><br>

I have never been perfect, and I never will be. I've only gone through ups and downs, but that is how life will be. There are many more ups and downs that I know that I'll go through, and I know that some day my adventure will end. <br><br>

I want to say thanks to you for reading through my page. It'll change a lot. Probably just as much as I change. But I know that there will be a day when it'll go under it's last change. So what? I don't care. I'll change it as much as I want when I can. <br><br>

I think there are a lot of things that I could've done better, a lot of things that I could've optimized, a lot of things I could've completed... but in full honesty it's fine that I haven't completed as much as I could've. It's fine that I haven't pushed as hard as I could've. It's fine that I wasn't all that I could become... <br><br>

Is it really fine? I... I don't know. I would like to say that yes, it's all fine; it's fine because I am fine with it. But why am I fine with it? What makes me want to finish this run with the things that I have, the experiences I've had, the few memories that I hold, and with the few things that I've accomplished? <br><br>

There's a part of me that wants to throw everything I have at everything I see, but I have a feeling that tells me that it'll really just mess me up and that I'll get burnt out faster than... paper. I guess. <br><br>

And yet another part of me asks "why try at all if you won't give it your all"? I think the answer there is that if I am constantly going at something, it doesn't let me always enjoy the thing that I'm doing. Sometimes things can only be enjoyed when giving it your all, other times, when you don't give it as much. <br><br>

I dunno. <br><br>

I just want to take this time to thank you. Thank you for checking out my page. Thank you for spending the time to talk with me. Thanks for taking the time to play games with me or to watch me play games. Thanks for reaching out. <br><br>

Thanks for taking the time to stop. <br>

    I'll keep running when I have motivation, I guess.
    And when I run out of motivation I'll need someone to carry me.
    There's no way I'll be able to carry myself to the end.

And there will be no knowing when life will end. Do I have the strength to really keep holding on, even when it gets rough? Even if God were to save His reponse\(s\) to when I die?)
