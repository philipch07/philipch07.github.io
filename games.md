Like most people, I've grown up playing games.
Unlike most people, I seem to get motion sick when playing computer games, but this seems to go away when I spend even more time playing them. The only problem is that each time I get motion sick, I have trouble doing anything for the rest of the day.

I mostly only play multiplayer games nowadays, primarily because I get ~scared~ playing single player games. Unfortunately that means that I can only play single player games when I have a friend who is with me. Fortunately that means that I can play single player games with a friend. I don't know why I get scared of playing single player games alone.

Most of the games I play are on steam.

Here's a list of some of the games that I've played a while for on steam (name of game, hrs):
- Dota 2, 3.2k+
- CSGO, 1.4k+
- Terraria, 500+
- TF2, 200+
- Brawlhalla, 200+
- Risk of Rain 2, 170+
- Risk of Rain, 80+
- Skyrim, 60+

There are also a few games that I've played which weren't on steam, however, I can't remember all of them. I do remember that I played a LOT of Destiny 2 back when it was on Battle.net, but I don't know how many hours I put into the game. It was definitely over a couple hundred, though.

There are a few games that I know I'll continue to play for a while:
- SSBM
- Genshin Impact

I play Melee as a way to keep my mind and hands moving. I play Genshin as a way to keep my mind off and to have some non-committal grind should I have any extra time. [\#FREEMELEE](https://youtu.be/ui0ExdoEBNA).

I am also looking to get controller plugs for my gcc since I have noticed my knuckles/hands feeling a bit annoyed after playing for a few hours. I will probably get a pair of short and tall plugs from Battle Beaver Customs, and will experiment with where they go (I typically use R to pshield, and I use L/R in the same direction that I wavedash. I L-cancel with L though.) 

My main game that I play is Dota 2. I will definitely be playing less during a semester as opposed to summer/winter breaks. My peak rank is Divine 2, and I have been extremely close to 5k but only attempted to get there once. I probably will be dropping Dota since it is quite a taxing game for me to play, especially since I have to play it a lot in order to play well.
