|           |                       Device                       |                                                                                                                     Comments                                                                                                                    |

|  Computer |      Acer Predator Helios 300 (2019) PH315-52      |                                                                             Pretty good laptop, controlled fans with notebook fan control, battery life is abysmal.                                                                             |
|    GPU    |                     GTX 1660 Ti                    | Pretty good GPU, runs all my games fairly well at 1080p (not constantly hitting 144hz, but almost always above 60 for non-vr) Would only recommend for VR if you get this at a crazy low price, otherwise just wait for better tech to come out |
|    CPU    | Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz, 2592 Mhz |                                                                     Pretty good CPU, runs steam games fairly well at 1080p Haven't done too many CPU intensive tasks though.                                                                    |
|    RAM    |                       16.0 GB                      |                                                                A necessity for anyone who does more than one thing, even more so if it's not upgradable in the case of a laptop.                                                                |
|  Storage  |                    1 tb NVMe SSD                   |                                                                             Runs insanely fast. I also have an SSD as part of the laptop, but that has less storage.                                                                            |

|  Mousepad |                      QCK Large                     |                                                                                            I primarily use 800 dpi, save for when in [games](/games)                                                                                            |
|  Keyboard |         Razer Blackwidow 2016 (razer green)        |                                                                                         This is a terrible keyboard.
